## Skills

Team player - I enjoy being a team player and can easily switch between different roles, whether it's exercising leadership responsibilities or cooperating with others to accomplish a shared objective.

Outcome Driven and time keeping - As I did my degree during lockdown, I developed outcome-driven mindset and efficient time management abilities. I set clear goals and timelines, approached problems logically, and managed my time effectively to achieve positive outcomes to meet deadlines.

Listening and Communication - Im my social groups I make sure to take the role of the neutral voice in any debate and understand the other peoples point of view and when speaking on a topic making sure my point is articulated and said in a way that people can understand my point fully. Also I feel understanding other peoples point of view before making any statement allows you to make it easier to explain your self and avoid offending others.

Problem solving - I'm confident in my strong problem-solving skills. I'm able to break down complex problems, analyze them thoroughly, and develop practical solutions. I'm not afraid to think outside the box and can adapt to changing circumstances.

Commitment - I completed the three-month Makers Academy coding bootcamp as a self-funded remote student, which required a great deal of self-discipline and focus. I am deeply committed to my work and take pride in seeing tasks through to completion.
